# Internal Conflict in Freudian Psychology

In Freudian psychology, the Id represents the instinctual and primitive part of the mind, seeking immediate gratification of basic needs and desires, while the Superego represents the moral and societal standards internalized by an individual.

These two components often come into conflict, especially in situations where fulfilling the desires of the Id may contradict the moral standards set by the Superego.

#### Here's an example:

Imagine a person who is on a strict diet due to health reasons, and they have a strong desire to eat a delicious but unhealthy dessert. In this scenario:

- The Id is driving the desire to indulge in the dessert, seeking immediate pleasure and gratification without considering the consequences.

- The Superego, on the other hand, holds the internalized moral standards and societal norms, reminding the person of the importance of maintaining their health and adhering to their diet.

So, the conflict arises between the immediate gratification sought by the Id and the moral standards upheld by the Superego. The individual may experience internal tension as they weigh the desire for pleasure against the adherence to their dietary restrictions for long-term health benefits. This internal conflict is a classic example of the ongoing dynamic between the Id and the Superego in Freudian psychology.

#### Another example:

- The Id, in this case, may drive the desire to avoid work and seek immediate pleasure or comfort, such as lounging around or engaging in leisure activities.

- The Superego, on the other hand, reminds the individual of their responsibilities and obligations, emphasizing the importance of fulfilling duties and meeting societal expectations.

The conflict arises between the desire for immediate gratification (represented by the Id's inclination towards laziness or leisure) and the moral standards and responsibilities (represented by the Superego's insistence on fulfilling duties and responsibilities).

In this scenario, the individual may experience internal tension and even anxiety as they grapple with the competing demands of the Id and the Superego. They may feel guilty for wanting to avoid work or feel anxious about the consequences of neglecting their responsibilities. This internal conflict can create psychological discomfort and may require the individual to find a balance between satisfying their desires and fulfilling their obligations.

### Anxiety because of the conflict

In Freudian psychology, conflicts between the Id and the Superego can indeed cause anxiety. This anxiety arises from the internal tension created by the conflicting desires and moral standards.

In the example provided, the individual may experience anxiety as they struggle to reconcile the desire to indulge in the dessert with the knowledge that doing so would violate their dietary restrictions and potentially harm their health. This conflict between immediate gratification and long-term well-being can generate feelings of guilt, shame, or unease, which are manifestations of anxiety according to Freudian theory.

Freud believed that unresolved conflicts between the Id, Ego, and Superego could lead to various psychological disturbances, including anxiety disorders. In this case, the anxiety arises from the struggle to navigate between the demands of the Id and the moral standards imposed by the Superego.
